# Make a Greeting Card

In this exercise, you'll practice HTML and CSS by making a greeting card.

To start, open index.html in your browser to see the Birthday Card website.

The starter code is a working website with a weird robot happy birthday card. The card opens when you click a button to reveal the 'inside' of the card.

## Your Task

Your task is to customize this card so that it looks totally different, but still has the "open to reveal" function.

- Edit **index.html** to create something of your very own.
- Edit **style.css** to customise your card to make it stand out.
- **Be creative!** 

_Don't be afraid to edit the code. If you get an error or want to go back remember you can press **ctrl + z** to undo or use version history._

## Instructions

Change each of these to complete the exercise. Your version might look very different from another student's version!

- Change what the card says (the text in `index.html`)
- Change the font of the text (You can use any [websafe fonts](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp) without any additional configuration) 
- Change the color of the text and background of the page
- Change the style of the button (try changing a combination of color, border, background-color, padding, border-radius, and/or box-shadow).

Run your site to make sure that the open and close buttons still work!

### Other things to try

You don't need to do these to complete the exercise, but they are fun!

- Change the images (You can upload your own by dragging and dropping them into the sidebar)
- Change the text of the buttons
- Add a [gradient background color](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp)

You can change other styles or content too! Try to make sure that the open and close buttons still work by clicking "Run" frequently.
